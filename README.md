#------------------------------------------- APPLICATIONS ARE USING OPENCV 4.0---------------------------------------------


#Face_Capture_With_Rotate.py: Running this file will capture 50 images of a person infront of with illumination and rotation correction.


#Free_Rotate.py: This file shows the rotate function. Make sure you uncomment line 153 in NameFind.py This will show the image correcting the offset.


#NameFind.py: This file contains all the functions.


#Trainer.py: This file will train LBPH recognition algorithm using the images in the photodb folder.


#Rec_LBPH_Antispoofing.py:  This script will recognise faces from the camera feed using LBPH facial recognition algorithm and eye-blink spoofing protection.

#Detect_blinks.py: This file will detect blinks in the camera stream
							

# ------------------FOLDERS -----------

#photodb --> Contains the images that will be used to train the recogniser


#Haar --> Contains Haar Cascades of OpenCV used in the applications


#recondata --> Contains the saved XML file with LBPH training data
